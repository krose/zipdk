# zipdk

The goal of zipdk is to have a few easy functions to map the postal codes, regions and municipalities with city, region and municipality names.

## Installation

You can install zipdk from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("krose/zipdk")
```

## Example

This is how you get the postal codes:

```{r zip}

dk_zips()

```

This is how you get the municipalities:

```{r muni}

dk_munis()

```

This is how you get the municipalities:

```{r regions}

dk_regions()

```

## Further Development

Pull requests are accepted.

I might geo code the data.
